# This configuration file will be evaluated by Puma. The top-level methods that
# are invoked here are part of Puma's configuration DSL. For more information
# about methods provided by the DSL, see https://puma.io/puma/Puma/DSL.html.
#
# Puma starts a configurable number of processes (workers) and each process
# serves each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
#
# You can control the number of workers using ENV["WEB_CONCURRENCY"]. You
# should only set this value when you want to run 2 or more workers. The
# default is already 1. You can set it to `auto` to automatically start a worker
# for each available processor.
#
# The ideal number of threads per worker depends both on how much time the
# application spends waiting for IO operations and on how much you wish to
# prioritize throughput over latency.
#
# As a rule of thumb, increasing the number of threads will increase how much
# traffic a given process can handle (throughput), but due to CRuby's
# Global VM Lock (GVL) it has diminishing returns and will degrade the
# response time (latency) of the application.
#
# The default is set to 3 threads as it's deemed a decent compromise between
# throughput and latency for the average Rails application.
#
# Any libraries that use a connection pool or another resource pool should
# be configured to provide at least as many connections as the number of
# threads. This includes Active Record's `pool` parameter in `database.yml`.
threads_count = ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS", 3)

# Specifies the `port` that Puma will listen on to receive requests; default is 3000.

# Allow puma to be restarted by `bin/rails restart` command.
plugin :tmp_restart

# Disconnect from live tentacle sessions before Puma re-execs on
# `bin/rails restart` or `pumactl restart`. When NEURAMD_FEATURE_DTACH=on,
# the shutdown path detaches without killing so children keep running
# and the next boot's bootstrap_sessions! reattaches. With the flag off,
# we fall back to the legacy graceful_stop_all (fires on_exit + persists
# transcripts + kills the PTY children). The systemctl-triggered SIGTERM
# path is covered by the at_exit hook in
# config/initializers/tentacle_graceful_shutdown.rb.
